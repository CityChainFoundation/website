                    <p>Bitcoin gave us digital money, a means of reliable and secure transfer of money to anyone, anywhere at
                        any time.</p>
                    <p>
                        The next step forward is to expand the usage and the availability of services that build on crypto-currencies and blockchain
                        technology, and applied those to cities, towns and its citizens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We want to make this technology available for everyone to use. And to do just that we are building the
                        <strong>City Chain</strong> blockchain and the
                        <strong>Smart City Platform</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Blockchain-technology is not a magic bullet that can be applied to every exisiting computer system. That is why we are building
                        the Smart City Platform on top of the City Chain, ensuring that we are utilizing the most optimal
                        technology for the different services and experiences provided by City Chain and the Smart City Platform.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cities and citizens will be able to use the City Chain to improve how we communicate, socialize, trade and manage our assets
                        (both physical and digital). In addition, it will be possible to reduce costs/overhead, and at the
                        same time empowering us with all the tools we need to take the
                        <strong>next step forward!</strong>

                        Any human society or city, is built upon the laws of commerce and trade. It is a fundamental principle of the human condition.
                        Without it, we wouldn't be were we are today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yet, the majority of trades are still done using either traditional cash payments, or through many obscure layers of financial
                        institutions and banking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Bitcoin and blockchain technologies, have in many ways disrupted how we look at the current financial institutions and banking,
                        but this technology is still new and different. It takes a lot of effort for the average citizen
                        to understand how it works, and how to adopt and benefit from it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That is why we started working on the
                        <strong>City Chain</strong> and the
                        <strong>Smart City Platform</strong>. The City Chain is a blockchain that will power the Smart City Platform.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That is where the
                        <strong>Smart City Platform</strong> enters, and with the primary goal of making crypto-technologies more
                        user friendly, and
                        <strong>available to everyone</strong>, no matter their technical expertise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Smart City Platform, with the City Hub built on top, will be your hub into the world of crypto-currencies and blockchain
                        technologies. The Smart City Platform will be powered by the
                        <strong>City Chain</strong> blockchain.

                    <p>To enable a more widespread acceptance and utilization of crypto-currencies it is required that the apps
                        and services are
                        <strong>easy and friendly</strong> to use. It should be both
                        <strong>delightful and enjoyable</strong> to use, so much that people will prefer it over existing methods.</p>
                    <p>Great usability does not come easily, it requires the best User Experience (UX) experts and graphical
                        designers that both understand users and the technology. Our developers have decades of experience
                        building consumer and business oriented software and services that have a high customer satisfaction.
                        These skills and experiences will be vital in the development of the Smart City Platform and services.</p>
                    <p>The apps and services that are part of the platform, is easily accessible to the citizens through the
                        <strong>City Hub</strong>. This app, which is accessible from any device, will abstract the technology as

                        Governments and cities services around the world have already started investigating and testing out blockchain-technologies,
                        and there are one of many examples, from the land registry of Sweden, where they estimate blockchain-technology
                        will cut hundreds of millions of dollars of expenses for the government (

                        First goal of the Smart City Platform is to make it easy to use and accessible for everyone, the second goal is to become
                        an umbrella for the multitude and wide range of services that are being built today on crypto-currency
                        and blockchain technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By relying on the Smart City Platform, and by owning City Coins, you as a citizen and individual, should be able to buy goods
                        and services without requiring any conversion of currencies, or repetitive tasks such as filling
                        out registration forms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your identities are stored securely on the City Chain blockchain, and when you purchase a new service, for example insurance,
                        which might exist on a different blockchain and rely on a different currency, you will get the benefits
                        from the integrations built into the Smart City Platform. You simply pick your services, select your
                        identities, and perform payments. The active subscriptions you have, and the history of payments,
                        are all accessible through your City Hub.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To enable this behavior, the platform and services must provide a rich set of APIs and user friendly apps for all platforms.
                        To develop the Smart City Platform will require time and resources, and it is starting now with the
                        City Chain and City Coin.

                        Liberstad is a new private city being established in the southern part of Norway. It is during these early stages of city
                        development, that we became aware of the challenges and obstacles to widespread usage of crypto-currencies
                        and blockchains technologies in the day to day interactions and trades that humans, merchants and
                        corporations does.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As long as the simplicity and utility of cash payments, or payments with credit cards, are easier than the crypto-currencies,
                        there won't be a widespread usage among the majority of trades and commerce going on around globe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Crypto-currencies are digital money, in a way that have never existed before in human history. The possibilities with digital
                        programmable money, are huge. To figure out those possibilities and utilize them, require a lot of
                        work. We are building the
                        <strong>Smart City Platform</strong> and the
                        <strong>City Chain</strong> blockchain so to enable existing cities, new cities and its citizens, access
                        to new experiences and services powered by blockchain-technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Smart City Platform can optimize and modernize how to plan, build and operate cities, enabling city operators to be more
                        efficient and deliver better services to its citizens. It will empower its citizens, with the means
                        to have control of their own data, financial values and identities.

                <strong>City Coin (CITY)</strong> is what you use on the City Chain. It is the medium of exchange and payment for
                services on the City Chain, and the Smart City Platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                The City Chain is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain, making it more accessible to people without the need for hardware investements
                for mining. Instead of mining, you can decide if you want to use your coins for staking. As a staker, you
                provide a service to the community and the network, and receive staking award in the form of new coins for
                every block you are selected to stake. Your chance to be elected for staking a block in the chain, depends
                on the amount of coins you are staking of the total network.

        <div class="container">
            <p>The
                <strong>Smart City Platform</strong> will host a number of software and services, that makes the crypto-currencies
                and blockchain-technologies available to everyone.</p>

            <h3>City Hub</h3>
            <p>This is your entrance hub into the Smart City Platform. All software and services mentioned below, will be integrated
                into the portal.</p>
            <p>City Hub will be accessible from any device, including iOS, Android, and desktop computers through the City Portal
                app and website.</p>

            <h3>City Chain blockchain</h3>
            <p>
                This is what will power the Smart City Platform, a new Proof-of-Stake (PoS) crypto-currency by the name City Coin. While
                the Smart City Platform is being built to integrate and run on multiple blockchains, this new blockchain
                will the be first and primary blockchain utilized by the Smart City Platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                New City Coins are produced through staking (PoS), which is something anyone who owns CITY can participate in.
            </p>

            <h3>Secure Messaging &amp; Community</h3>
            <p>
                Already under development, is a secure community app being built to allow anyone to contribute to communities in a secure,
                and private manner. If a user wants to stay entirely anonymous, that is possible. The app runs without any
                major infrastructure, no installations or servers required. All data is stored in the web browser and is
                never sent unencrypted over the network.
            </p>
            <p>
                For free, anyone can create their own secure communities which has zero centralized storage. A paid service will be available
                for secure and encrypted centralized storage of communities, making content syncronization faster and secure
                backup of content.
            </p>
            <h3>Wallet Software</h3>
            <p>
                It is a fairly known fact that blockchain technology and crypto-currencies still are only accessible to individuals with
                basic technical skills. It is essential that crypto-currencies are made accessible and available to everyone,
                without any technical skills. A user with a smart phone, should easily be able to pickup the wallet-app and
                start transfering funds into their account, and payment for goods in stores should be instant and seamless.
            </p>
            <p>
                Being able to perform transactions using NFC will be an important aspect of the wallet app for the City Coin, allowing users
                to quickly perform small-sum transactions without any confirmation other than physical access to a phone.
                The limits for NFC payments is controlled entirely by you, the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                The City Coin is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) crypto-coin, and a full-node desktop software will be available for Windows, Mac
                and Linux. The City Chain Foundation will be hosting a number of full-nodes to ensure network stability and
                safety.
            </p>
            <p>
                While we will have our own wallet app to ensure great user experience, we are working with others to ensure that City Coin
                is widely adopted and supported by other wallet software.
            </p>
            <p>City Hub supports different usage modes, and from launch will support both mobile and desktop.</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Mobile</strong> - Mobile optimized, released to appstores on Android and iOS.</li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Light</strong> - Light node UI that does not require download of full blockchain.</li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Full</strong> - Full node UI that support staking, and does a complete verification of the blockchain.</li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Point-of-Sale (POS)</strong> - Merchant UI that is optimized for touch screen usage.</li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Read-only</strong> - A more secure mode that allows you to see all your data, without using your
                        private key.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Identity Framework</h3>
            <p>
                You are the source of your identities, and how and what you identity as, is up to you. If you want to change your name that
                you are using for trades and interactions with anyone, that is available to you. You can choose to have a
                single identity, or multiple.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you interact with others through the Smart City Platform, your identities will build up trust. Similar to how trust is
                important in a human society today, it will be even more important in the digital space going forward.
            </p>
            <p>
                City Chain is planning to support the
                <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) specification, including implementation of Universal Resolver, Universal
                Registrar and Identity Hubs. By implementing these open specifications, you can potentially use your identity
                on the City Chain, to authenticate across multiple desentralized blockchains and systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Integration with other blockchains are planned for the identity framework, including Keybase.io. We are planning to apply
                for a membership in the
                <a href="http://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>.

            </p>

            <h3>Contacts</h3>
            <p>As you know already, having a user friendly and easy to use list of contact is very valuable in your daily life.
                On the Smart City Platform, your contacts will be stored encrypted and securely. They can be connected to
                identities that exists on the platform, enabling frictionless payments between you, and all your contacts.
                Simply search for an individual, and make a crypto-currency payment in seconds.
            </p>

            <h3>Merchant Framework</h3>
            <p>
                The merchant framework on the platform is a very important piece of the whole. The platform will enable existing merchants
                to improve their sales and customer experiences, but the platform will also enable just about anyone, to
                become a merchant that sells goods and services, both online and offline in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stability is often important for a merchant, so the framework will support the ability to receive payment in the currency
                of choice by the merchant. If you want to have a local fiat currency, you can do so. If you want a mix of
                currencies, that is possible too.
            </p>
            <p>
                Integrations with existing webshop frameworks will be added, allowing merchants to easily integrate into the Smart City Platform,
                while continue to use existing software for online trading.
            </p>
            <p>Merchant registry will be part of the merchant framework, and allow citizens to discover the merchants that are
                available in various cities. These have metadata registered informing citizens what services are provided,
                and how payments can be done. This enables you as a citizen, to pick providers that use modern technologies
                such as crypto-currencies, and which merchant that integrates into the Smart City Platform. This enables
                you to have a more detailed transaction history, than what you otherwise would have.</p>

            <h3>Voting Framework</h3>
            <p>
                Humans often have a need to have their voice heard. Part of that, is the ability to vote on issues of concern. As either
                a citizen, or employee, we want to feel we have an impact on major decisions being made.
            </p>
            <p>
                Part of the Smart City Platform, will be the voting framework, which will enable anyone to create voting polls, that will
                be both transparent, secure and anonymous (if needed). You as the user of this service, can set and configure
                how you want to a voting to be executed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The voting framework will be used by the Liberstad Incubator Program (LIP), to allow investors to vote on suggested applications
                to the incubator program. It will also be used by the City Chain Foundation, allowing individuals who hold
                City Coins to vote on issues, suggestions and more.
            </p>

            <h3>Property Registry</h3>
            <p>
                Registry built on blockchain for property registrations will be part of the Smart City Platform, likely through integration
                with other existing blockchains built for the specific purpose of property registrations.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are already governments that have started using blockchain for property registrations, and what is important on the
                Smart City Platform, is for citizens to be able to see their properties and all the details that belongs
                to it.
            </p>

            <p>
                As an owner of vehicles, you will be able to register your vehicles on the City Hub. Integration with either/or both the
                <a href="#">VINchain</a> and
                <a href="#">carVertical</a> will ensure that you, have access too all the relevant details and history of your vehicles.

            <h3>Insurance</h3>
            <p>Insurance is an important part of a modern society, helping individuals, families and business survive the unforseen.</p>
            <p>There are existing established and under development, insurance-platforms on blockchain technologies. The Smart
                City Platform will be built with integrations into existing insurance blockchain platforms, allowing citizens
                and others to get insurance coverage easy and seamless. Etherisc and Insurepal are two potential platforms
                for insurance integration.
            </p>

            </p>

            <h3>(Smart) Contracts</h3>
            <p>In life we have many different contracts that we have signed with others. This module on the Smart City Platform,
                gives you an overview of all your contracts that are enacted on blockchain-technologies. You can additionally
                upload and safely store copies of contracts that you scan.
            </p>
            <p>
                This module also allows you to import the details of any token-based smart contracts you have purchased. In the first version
                support for Ethereum will be added, and other smart contract platforms might be supported in the future based
                on user demand.
            </p>

            <h3>Subscriptions</h3>
            <p>Life in the city often involves subscriptions that have a recurring payment. This module on the Smart City Platform,
                gives you insight into all subscription contracts you have, either with the city services, or with any other
                merchant.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of the time today, we as citiziens don't know much about the services we subscribe to, what payment and service plans
                we subscribe to, and others details. Some services only supply some details through regular mail, while others
                have limited self-service ability through their websites. We need to login at every individuals service,
                with no easy overview and control.
            </p>
            <p>
                The promise of the subscriptions module on the platform, is the ability to get better insight into your existing subscriptions,
                and improved visibility into possible subscriptions available in the city and beyond.
            </p>
            <p>
                Examples on subscriptions you might have stored on the platform, includes waste services, water services, city-bicycle rental,
                city-car sharing and more.
            </p>
            <h3>Certifications</h3>
            <p>Digitizing and verifying academic credentials will be part of the platform. This can be used as a foundation
                for corporations to validate employment candidates, and it can be used by private or public educators to
                give cryptographically verifiable certifications.
            </p>

            <h4>Note regarding third party integrations</h4>
            <p class="smaller">
                Third parties that the Smart City Platform will integrate with, is not necessarily associated partners with City Chain. For
                most third party integrations, we will rely on public available APIs. Listing of third party logos is not
                an endorsement.
                <br> Not all planned integrations are currently available, for example car VIN blockchains are currently ongoing
                ICOs. As the market matures, we will reconsider which integrations we will do.

                <span class="faq-letter">Q:</span> How will you be able to develop all features of Smart City Platform?</p>
            <p>
                <span class="faq-letter">A:</span> City Chain and Smart City Platform is the future of cities in many ways, and will be expanding
                in functionality throughtout the coming years. Majority of this development will be finance through the donations
                given to the City Chain Foundation. We have a fantastic team of developers that are very productive and experienced.
                Additionally the platform is being built on highly productive programming tools and languages.

            <p>
                <span class="faq-letter">Q:</span> What is the difference between Liberstad (the city), Smart City Platform, City Chain and City Coin?</p>
            <p>
                <span class="faq-letter">A:</span>
                <strong>
                    <a href="https://www.liberstad.com/" target="_blank">Liberstad</a>
                </strong> (the city) is a project to establish the first private city in Norway. It is currently under construction
                and is located at Tjelland, in Marnadal municipality in Norway. The city will depend heavily on blockchain-technologies
                to reduce costs and create a modern infrastructure for its city services.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Smart City Platform</strong> is the platform for software and services that will be developed, building on
                the City Chain. Smart City Platform will have a wide array of software and services that can be utilized
                by cities, municipalities, corporations, merchants and citiziens.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>City Chain</strong> is the blockchain that hosts the Smart City Platform. It will be fundamental to the operation
                of the Smart City Platform. The City Chain will be a fork of existing blockchain, which one has not yet been
                decided.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>City Coin</strong>, with the official abbreviation of CITY, will be the cryptocurrency running on the City
                Chain.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="faq-letter">Q:</span> Why are you using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and not Proof-of-Work (PoW)?
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="faq-letter">A:</span>
                <strong>Proof-of-Stake</strong> is in some ways, an enhancement of Proof-of-Work, and it enables secure blockchain
                without the demand for hardware investement and large energy expenditure to keep the blockchain network going.
                There are continuous development on consensus algorithms in the industry (of PoW and PoS are two of many
                algorithms) and the City Chain is commited to follow the development and be progressive in terms of adopting
                newer algorithms should they be better aligned with the philosophy and needs of the platform.
